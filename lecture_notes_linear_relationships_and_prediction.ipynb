The new idea is that two variables may have shapes such that one is a function of the other. As X increases, so does Y, OR: As X increases, Y decreases.\n",

    "### Statistical Learning Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Important distinction between dependent and independent variables. Beware that an image on learn.co assimilates these to effect and cause, respectively!\n",
    "\n",
    "A better explanation is that the independent variable is what can be directly manipulated and the dependent variable is what cannot be (but is nevertheless of great interest). But this is also problematic since we often take e.g. time as an independent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe best: The dependent variable is the one we want to think of as a function of the independent variable: \"How does \\[dep\\] change as a function of \\[indep\\]?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the proper interpretation of a statistical _model_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple idea: Line as model!\n",
    "\n",
    "This model has two _parameters_: _slope_ and _y-intercept_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Validation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Loss Functions? Quick version (more later): The loss function represents the _loss_ of accuracy that we get by assuming the truth of our model. We therefore want to _minimize_ that function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding the best-fit line y = mx + b. Note: The formal proof of this proceeds by setting the derivative of the loss function to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "slope: $m = r\\frac{\\sigma_y}{\\sigma_x}$\n",
    "\n",
    "y-intercept: $b = \\mu_y - m\\mu_x$\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The relationship between target and predictor(s) is linear.\n",
    "2. The errors are mutually independent.\n",
    "3. The errors are normally distributed.\n",
    "4. The errors are homoskedastic.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Application_: <br/>\n",
    "Continue example from before! Now that we have the correlation for our two variables X and Y, we can calculate the slope of the best-fit line. And once we have that, we can calculate the y-intercept of that same line (which fully determines it).\n",

    "### Coefficient of Determination\n",
    "\n",
    "Very often a data scientist will calculate $R^2$ as a measure of how well the model fits the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "$R^2$ for a model is ultimately a _relational_ notion. It's a measure of goodness of fit _relative_ to a (bad) baseline model. This bad baseline model is simply the horizontal line $y = \\mu_Y$, for dependent variable Y.\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual calculation of $R^2$ is $\\frac{\\Sigma_i(y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2}{\\Sigma_i(y_i - \\bar{y})^2}$.\n",

    "$R^2$ takes values between 0 and 1.\n",

    "\\[Time permitting:\n",
    "### Hypothesis Testing and p-Values\n",
    "\n",
    "Null and alternative hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, the null hypothesis (NH) will state that there is no relationship between two variables. We'll _reject_ the NH when we have reason to believe that the two variables are correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "_How much_ correlated? _How much_ reason? This makes for another parameter, but often we'll be looking at _95\\%_-confidence intervals.\\]\n",
